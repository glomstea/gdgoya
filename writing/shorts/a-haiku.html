		<h1>A Haiku</h1>

		<p>
			A haiku consists<br />
			Of five, seven, and then five<br />
			Syllables to list. <br />
			<br />
			They provide us bliss<br />
			Through their mechanics, and their<br />
			Graceful poet&rsquo;s kiss. <br />
			<br />
			A Haiku can prove<br />
			To be an undertaking <br />
			For us to exude. <br />
			<br />
			Writing a haiku<br />
			Can be a daunting process<br />
			And takes time to smooth.<br />
			<br />
			Still, I sit and write.<br />
			The words jumbled in my mind<br />
			Fill the page with might. <br />
			<br />
			I ty to sound right.<br />
			Yet, I can seem pretentious<br />
			And outright contrite. <br />
			<br />
			Nonetheless I move<br />
			The pencil in my cold hand<br />
			As my handy tool. <br />
			<br />
			What I say to you<br />
			May seem absolutely wrong<br />
			And a little cruel. <br />
			<br />
			But, I must atone<br />
			Through these words, structure, and my<br />
			Earnest, sad poem. <br />
			<br />
			But, what have I done<br />
			To warrant a confession<br />
			I will tell no one?<br />
			<br />
			I will tell you now<br />
			How I was with my brother<br />
			And I struck him down&hellip;<br />
			<br />
			With the greatest frown<br />
			I left my lover in angst<br />
			And went into town. <br />
			<br />
			We parted with stress<br />
			And I sought my dear sibling<br />
			To relieve the mess. <br />
			<br />
			He brought much success,<br />
			And within minutes, I had<br />
			The grief off my chest.<br />
			<br />
			But, with great concern,<br />
			I discovered a secret<br />
			No one man should learn.<br />
			<br />
			My poor heart burned<br />
			When I saw my lady&rsquo;s lace<br />
			On his floor, upturned. <br />
			<br />
			It was so obscene. <br />
			For my brother and lover<br />
			To do this to me. <br />
			<br />
			With their lies and schemes<br />
			My thoughts raced for revenge.<br />
			Blood, guts, gore, and spleens. <br />
			<br />
			My hand as a mace,<br />
			I sought great wraith upon him<br />
			And caved his face.<br />
			<br />
			Dashing to her place,<br />
			I strangled her lovely neck,<br />
			And sat in distaste. <br />
			<br />
			Then, I discovered<br />
			The same lace in her drawer<br />
			And my skin shuddered. <br />
			<br />
			Sibling and lover,<br />
			Both slaughtered by my mistake.<br />
			Poor girl, dead brother. <br />
			<br />
			And now, in my cell.<br />
			I sit and rot while waiting<br />
			For my turn in hell. <br />
			<br />
			I can scream, or yell,<br />
			But haikus, in their beauty,<br />
			Keep me sane and well. <br />
			<br />
			-	G.D. Goya
