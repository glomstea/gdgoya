		<p>
			I wake from a nap.<br />
			Almost five o&rsquo;clock.<br />
			The sun begins it&rsquo;s<br />
			Long journey to the <br />
			Horizon<br />
			<br />
			The lake is warm but<br />
			I don&rsquo;t swim for long.<br />
			On the patio<br />
			I lay out to dry.<br />
			It&rsquo;s a nice day.<br />
			<br />
			My dad opens the<br />
			Side gate and stands<br />
			Next to me. His 100<br />
			Dollar silk tie is loose<br />
			On his neck.<br />
			<br />
			My dad stands and<br />
			Stares into space<br />
			His hand on my shoulder.<br />
			His nice button up shirt<br />
			Is stained red.<br />
			<br />
			Dad? I ask. He doesn&rsquo;t <br />
			Respond, he just stares<br />
			Into space. I go get mom. <br />
			She comforts him<br />
			And he jumps into the lake.<br />
			<br />
			The blood comes off <br />
			And he sits on the <br />
			edge of the dock.<br />
			He tells his story.<br />
			I listen from a far. <br />
			<br />
			The biker had been <br />
			Going about 60.<br />
			He passed my dad and sped<br />
			Around the corner. <br />
			His bike lost traction. <br />
			<br />
			My father had pulled<br />
			Up beside him.<br />
			The man was a Mess. <br />
			Coughing up blood<br />
			And bleeding from his ears.<br />
			<br />
			He tried to help.<br />
			But the people around him<br />
			Didn&rsquo;t. An old couple<br />
			Standing not far away,<br />
			Just staring.<br />
			<br />
			He screamed for<br />
			Someone to call 911.<br />
			Everyone just stood and<br />
			Stared, too shocked<br />
			To do a thing.<br />
			<br />
			Beneath him the smell<br />
			Of blood, and alcohol.<br />
			The ambulance came.<br />
			Perhaps too late.<br />
			And it was only 5 o&rsquo;clock.<br />
			<br />
			-	G.D. Goya (2012)
